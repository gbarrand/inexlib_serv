<p>At startup a simple graphical interface (GUI in the following) appears. It is composed for the moment of the bottom home, back, camera, parameters buttons along with a central list of buttons. Simply touch (click on a desktop) a button to navigate in the GUI.</p>
<p>To setup inexlib_serv, you have to declare the local host IP address along an available port. To do that: </p><pre class="fragment">     sg_serv -&gt; initialize -&gt; (this ip/port) -&gt; ok.
</pre><p> If all is ok you should see a green "started". Use the declared IP/port when starting a remote client.</p>
<p>Note that on a Linux, macOS or iOS device connected to internet, inexlib_serv will propose by default the correct IP address. On Windows and Android, we had not been able yet (on the 1.0.x versions) to find the correct piece of code to retrieve this address at first shot, and you may have to enter it by hand in the text area at the right of "this ip". On a Windows, you can find it from a DOS prompt with "ipconfig", and on an Android device you can find it "somewhere" under the "Settings" menu. The exact place depends of the version of Android you have. If needed, on macOS and Linux, you can find the IP address with "ifconfig". In general it is on the "en0" interface.</p>
<p>When started, inexlib_serv waits scene graphs from a remote client. When receiving one, in general it passes in "view mode" by visualizing it and the behaviour of the application is then the same as other softinex ones. The home button permits to return to the top list of buttons whilst the back button returns to the previous list. When visualizing something, the GUI disappears to let the place, full screen, to the "scene". A non visible "meta zone" exists at the bottom that permits, when touched (clicked on a desktop), to map again the GUI.</p>
<p>When having a scene, the camera button permits to map a panel that let you move around the camera. As the general behaviour of the application is similar to the ioda application and a-like, we refer to the "Apps general behaviour" section of the softinex portal for documentation about camera manipulation, producing output, about the document directory on a smart device, etc... You can have also demos of softinex apps on YouTube under the "Guy barrand channel". </p>
